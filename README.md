# Battleships — Python Strategy Game

A console-based version of the classic Battleships game, built in **Python**.  
Players take turns placing ships and attacking each other's grids, with real-time feedback and a focus on clean, modular code design.  
The project demonstrates turn-based logic, data validation, and object-oriented programming principles.
